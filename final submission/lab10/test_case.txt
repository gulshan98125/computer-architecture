mov r2, r2, LSL #6  -- r2 here becomes 6528
strb r2, [r1, #2] -- with B_bit = 1, since RES(i.e address)(1 downto 0)="11" so 4th data memory has write enable = 1
ldr r3, [r1, #2] --r3 here contains 7downto0 of 6528 which is 128 i.e.  000...01000000

ldrsb r3, [r1, #2] --with SH="10" i.e. signed byte we get r3 = 111...11110000000 which is -128

MUL r0, r1, r2 -- r0 here gets -816
MLA r0, r1, r2, r3 ; r0 = (r1 * r2) + r3 i.e. r0 now has -816+128= -688

SMULL r4,r5, r1,r2  --r5:r4 = r2*r1 , now r5 will get -1 i.e. 111...11 and r4 will get -816


102 = "000...01100110"
6630 = "000...01100111100110"

-688 = 111...110101010000
-816 = 111...110011010000
